# First version of the Project
### First version of the model, there will be improvements;
  - Classification head will be changed after training (the code is not ready)
  - Cross valdiation will be applied (the code is ready but not tried to run)
  - Canny Edge Detection code will be added after processing step (before model initialization)
  - In this version the architecture is tried to run with only 100ish images, just to test.

**Note:** the main file is the main.ipynb notebook where all of the architecture goes on and we run that notebook, others are only modules for functions and the main.ipynb  calls those modules within.
